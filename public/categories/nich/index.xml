      <description>HEY GUYS !!! I&amp;rsquo;m finally DONEÂ with school and am totally ready to start building the new website (yayyy, I only have like 4 days left to build it), but before I do, I just want to write a brief post about what exactly is a static website.
If you take all the websites that exist, you can separate them into 2 broad categories. The first one is Dynamic Websites and the second one is Static Websites.</description>

      <description>My first challenge is to build a static website that will replace the current website in 2018.
Background:
I&amp;rsquo;ve always had an interest in building a static website, but I never found any good motivation to do it so when HughSamBros came up, I jumped at the gun and told Alex that I&amp;rsquo;ll take care of the website. The initial plan was to start right off the bat with the static website and document everything on it; however, I wanted the site to be my first challenge.</description>
