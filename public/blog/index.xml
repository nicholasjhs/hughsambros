      <title>NKC#2: Introducing the Rap Challenge</title>

      <description>My second challenge of 2018 is the rap freestyle challenge!
Background: Imagine the scene where you&amp;rsquo;re at a metro station or a public space and someone starts playing an instrumental song. The beat is real nice, but you won&amp;rsquo;t listen to it more than 3 minutes because it gets repetitive. Suddenly, a dude comes out of nowhere, grabs a mic and starts rapping off his head aka freestyling. Then, people start filming, people post on youtube, shit gets 20M views, the dude goes on Ellen and the rest is history.</description>

      <description>My second challenge of 2018 is the rap freestyle challenge!
Background:
If you&amp;rsquo;ve known me for a while, then you probably know that I love hip-hop and rap (extra props if you know who my favourite rapper is). To be completely honest, I&amp;rsquo;ve always put more importance to the beat and the vibe of the song, more so than the actual lyrics (yup just lost all my street cred), but I still love going on RapGenius to look up the meaning of the lyrics of each song I listen to.</description>

      <description>Hey !! This is a recap post about my challenges, as a bonus I even put an extra meal that I did (my own recipe, waddup Gordon).
I don&amp;rsquo;t really know how to organize this post so I&amp;rsquo;ll just write the same format as Alex and then randomly insert pictures of my final results.
All in all, I would give myself a pass, but I only passed the taste test and failed every other criteria that I set myself so&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m the only one that can be blamed for that&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone! Yup, I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty bad with updating the blog, BUT unlike the vision board, I was able to complete the challenge (GO ME)!!
Since I haven&amp;rsquo;t uploaded a lot, here&amp;rsquo;s me ALMOST completing the challenge the day before:   And here&amp;rsquo;s a video of me completing the challenge the morning after with a few kids in the background watching me do it (can only hear them not see them):   What I did well:</description>

      <description>In life, we need to learn how to adapt and since I am a handicap track boy who currently can&amp;rsquo;t do shit with my legs, I had to move most of my physical challenges at the end of the year. Since we&amp;rsquo;re at it, why not re-do the whole order to make it more optimal (for example, Alex is planning to go to Guatemala in June so why not do the &amp;ldquo;Learn a New Language Challenge&amp;rdquo; the month before !</description>

      <description>It was a Wednesday night I think (I actually don&amp;rsquo;t know, it just sounds cool to have a specific day) and I was casually scrolling on Facebook, doing my relaxing-brainless activity of the day when I stumbled across a video of a couple doing cooking show called &amp;lsquo;Night In/ Night out&amp;rsquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty cool concept, where this average couple compares the worth of having a night in vs a night out.</description>

      <description>I LOVE SOUTH AMERICAN FOOD. And I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about the actual taste because I don&amp;rsquo;t think I ever ate any authentic South American food; I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the idea of rice, beans, meat, avocado, salsa, tomatoes, onions and plantains all packed together into a single dirt cheap, but utterly delicious meal ! Now, I know, those probably aren&amp;rsquo;t the most healthy meals, but hey, can&amp;rsquo;t a man just enjoy his good food in peace?</description>

      <title>AKC#1: Hockey Update</title>

      <description>This challenge has been a lot harder than what I thought, and not for the reasons that I thought either! Let me explain. For one, it&amp;rsquo;s fairly hard to find a right time to go out and practice on ice, because it has to be perfect conditions.
It can&amp;rsquo;t be rainy, it can&amp;rsquo;t be snowy (if not you can easily lose your pucks, you have to shovel a lot and you have less space to actually play) and it can&amp;rsquo;t be freezing outside (by freezing, I mean lower than -30 oC).</description>

      <description>Ever since I can remember, Wednesdays have always been pasta day in our house. I always found it really peculiar that we had a pasta day in an asian household. I mean, think about it, how many asian families do you know that doesn&amp;rsquo;t eat white rice everyday and even worse, that eats pasta EVERY Wednesday? I, personally, don&amp;rsquo;t know any other asian household, but I guess it has to do less with the fact that we&amp;rsquo;re asian and more with the fact that my mom absolutely LOVES Italian cooking.</description>

      <description>My first challenge of 2018 is the hockey challenge!
Background:
My love for hockey has been back and forth while growing up. I&amp;rsquo;ve only played casual hockey when I was younger, and only recently have I decided to join a league (a ball hockey league, since I JUST decided to learn how to skate). So I am not starting from scratch, but I am very far away from being a &amp;lsquo;good&amp;rsquo; hockey player.</description>

      <description>My second challenge is to be able to cook by the end of January 2018.
Why I&amp;rsquo;m Doing a Cooking Challenge:
I simply don&amp;rsquo;t know how to cook. Okay yes, I can cook instant ramen, make eggs in the morning, put a toast in the toaster and spread some butter or peanut butter on it, but I don&amp;rsquo;t ACTUALLY know how to cook anything else. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit sad to say, but at 22 years old, if my mom would leave us at home for 2 weeks straight, we would probably gain 5lbs each from always eating out or die (one of the two, no in-betweens really).</description>

      <title>AKC#0: First Challenge... Failed</title>

      <description>Yup. I failed. The first challenge of this project and I am starting with a failure. Certainly, not the way I wanted my 2017 to end, but it is what it is. Instead of sulking and making excuses for why I didn&amp;rsquo;t complete this challenge, I thought it would be a lot more instructional for me to list what were my mistakes and what I could&amp;rsquo;ve done instead to turn this failure into a learning experience.</description>

      <description>As you can see, the site is still the same and that is because I have FAILED my first challenge&amp;hellip;. I really wanted to go LIVE with the real website before 2018, but I guess that 6 days isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to learn how to build and DEPLOY a website. However, the good news is that I managed to complete it today and I really like the results. Right now, the only thing left to do is to connect it to Netlify CMS, which is a content management software tool that will allow Alex and I to write our posts online instead of having to write &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo; aka directly in the file.</description>

      <description>Alright, so it&amp;rsquo;s December 29th and I still haven&amp;rsquo;t started my vision board. What&amp;rsquo;s worst, is that I have something planned every day until the New Year, so I have even less (no) time to complete my challenge! BUT NO EXCUSES! I am going to start the New Years on a good note and complete this vision board. At the very least, I already bought a cork board and some pins as well, so that&amp;rsquo;s a start.</description>

      <title>NKC#0: Whats a Static Website</title>

      <description>HEY GUYS !!! I&amp;rsquo;m finally DONE with school and am totally ready to start building the new website (yayyy, I only have like 4 days left to build it), but before I do, I just want to write a brief post about what exactly is a static website.
If you take all the websites that exist, you can separate them into 2 broad categories. The first one is Dynamic Websites and the second one is Static Websites.</description>

      <title>AKC#0: Create a Vision Board</title>
      <link>https://www.hughsambros.com/blog/2017/12/akc0-create-a-vision-board/</link>

      <guid>https://www.hughsambros.com/blog/2017/12/akc0-create-a-vision-board/</guid>
      <description>My first challenge is to create my own vision board.
Background:
Around a year ago, I decided to get a life coach, because I was really interested in self development, and since I had some extra cash lying around, I decided to use that to good use and invest it on myself. After a few sessions with her, one of my tasks was to create a vision board. To be completely honest, I did a really botched job of creating one, and didn&amp;rsquo;t even look at it or use it after the fact.</description>

      <description>My first challenge is to build a static website that will replace the current website in 2018.
Background:
I&amp;rsquo;ve always had an interest in building a static website, but I never found any good motivation to do it so when HughSamBros came up, I jumped at the gun and told Alex that I&amp;rsquo;ll take care of the website. The initial plan was to start right off the bat with the static website and document everything on it; however, I wanted the site to be my first challenge.</description>

      <description>The whole idea of starting hughsambros.com came after I read through Max Deutsch&amp;rsquo;s project he called Month to Master (M2M). During this project, Max spent one year trying to complete 12 super hard challenges (tackling 1 every month) such as drawing a realistic self-portrait, solving a Rubik&amp;rsquo;s cube in 20 seconds, memorizing the order of a deck of cards in less two minutes and doing a freestyle-rap for 3 min.</description>
