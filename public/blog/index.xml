      <title>AKC1: Hockey Update</title>

      <description>This challenge has been a lot harder than what I thought, and not for the reasons that I thought either! Let me explain. For one, it&amp;rsquo;s fairly hard to find a right time to go out and practice on ice, because it has to be perfect conditions.
It can&amp;rsquo;t be rainy, it can&amp;rsquo;t be snowy (if not you can easily lose your pucks, you have to shovel a lot and you have less space to actually play) and it can&amp;rsquo;t be freezing outside (by freezing, I mean lower than -30 oC).</description>

      <title>NKC#1: My First Meal</title>

      <description>Ever since I can remember, Wednesdays have always been pasta day in our house. I always found it really peculiar that we had a pasta day in an asian household. I mean, think about it, how many asian families do you know that doesn&amp;rsquo;t eat white rice everyday and even worse, that eats pasta EVERY Wednesday? I, personally, don&amp;rsquo;t know any other asian household, but I guess it has to do less with the fact that we&amp;rsquo;re asian and more with the fact that my mom absolutely LOVES Italian cooking.</description>

      <description>My first challenge of 2018 is the hockey challenge!
Background:
My love for hockey has been back and forth while growing up. I&amp;rsquo;ve only played casual hockey when I was younger, and only recently have I decided to join a league (a ball hockey league, since I JUST decided to learn how to skate). So I am not starting from scratch, but I am very far away from being a &amp;lsquo;good&amp;rsquo; hockey player.</description>

      <title>NKC#1: the Cooking Challenge</title>

      <description>My second challenge is to be able to cook by the end of January 2018.
Why I&amp;rsquo;m Doing a Cooking Challenge:
I simply don&amp;rsquo;t know how to cook. Okay yes, I can cook instant ramen, make eggs in the morning, put a toast in the toaster and spread some butter or peanut butter on it, but I don&amp;rsquo;t ACTUALLY know how to cook anything else. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit sad to say, but at 22 years old, if my mom would leave us at home for 2 weeks straight, we would probably gain 5lbs each from always eating out or die (one of the two, no in-betweens really).</description>

      <title>AKC#0: First Challenge... Failed</title>

      <description>Yup. I failed. The first challenge of this project and I am starting with a failure. Certainly, not the way I wanted my 2017 to end, but it is what it is. Instead of sulking and making excuses for why I didn&amp;rsquo;t complete this challenge, I thought it would be a lot more instructional for me to list what were my mistakes and what I could&amp;rsquo;ve done instead to turn this failure into a learning experience.</description>

      <title>NKC#0: Im Done !!... Kinda</title>

      <description>As you can see, the site is still the same and that is because I have FAILED my first challenge&amp;hellip;. I really wanted to go LIVE with the real website before 2018, but I guess that 6 days isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to learn how to build and DEPLOY a website. However, the good news is that I managed to complete it today and I really like the results. Right now, the only thing left to do is to connect it to Netlify CMS, which is a content management software tool that will allow Alex and I to write our posts online instead of having to write &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo; aka directly in the file.</description>

      <description>Alright, so it&amp;rsquo;s December 29th and I still haven&amp;rsquo;t started my vision board. What&amp;rsquo;s worst, is that I have something planned every day until the New Year, so I have even less (no) time to complete my challenge! BUT NO EXCUSES! I am going to start the New Years on a good note and complete this vision board. At the very least, I already bought a cork board and some pins as well, so that&amp;rsquo;s a start.</description>

      <title>NKC#0: Whats a Static Website</title>
      <link>https://www.hughsambros.com/blog/2017/12/nkc0-whats-a-static-website/</link>

      <description>HEY GUYS !!! I&amp;rsquo;m finally DONEÂ with school and am totally ready to start building the new website (yayyy, I only have like 4 days left to build it), but before I do, I just want to write a brief post about what exactly is a static website.
If you take all the websites that exist, you can separate them into 2 broad categories. The first one is Dynamic Websites and the second one is Static Websites.</description>

      <title>AKC#0: Create a Vision Board</title>
      <link>https://www.hughsambros.com/blog/2017/12/akc0-create-a-vision-board/</link>

      <guid>https://www.hughsambros.com/blog/2017/12/akc0-create-a-vision-board/</guid>
      <description>My first challenge is to create my own vision board.
Background:
Around a year ago, I decided to get a life coach, because I was really interested in self development, and since I had some extra cash lying around, I decided to use that to good use and invest it on myself. After a few sessions with her, one of my tasks was to create a vision board. To be completely honest, I did a really botched job of creating one, and didn&amp;rsquo;t even look at it or use it after the fact.</description>

      <guid>https://www.hughsambros.com/blog/2017/12/nkc0-build-a-static-website/</guid>
      <description>My first challenge is to build a static website that will replace the current website in 2018.
Background:
I&amp;rsquo;ve always had an interest in building a static website, but I never found any good motivation to do it so when HughSamBros came up, I jumped at the gun and told Alex that I&amp;rsquo;ll take care of the website. The initial plan was to start right off the bat with the static website and document everything on it; however, I wanted the site to be my first challenge.</description>

      <title>KC: Introducing the Kaizen Challenge</title>
      <link>https://www.hughsambros.com/blog/2017/12/kc-introducing-the-kaizen-challenge/</link>

      <description>The whole idea of starting hughsambros.com came after I read through Max Deutsch&amp;rsquo;s project he called Month to Master (M2M). During this project, Max spent one year trying to complete 12 super hard challenges (tackling 1 every month) such as drawing a realistic self-portrait, solving a Rubik&amp;rsquo;s cube in 20 seconds, memorizing the order of a deck of cards in less two minutes and doing a freestyle-rap for 3 min.</description>
