                    <p>Hey !! This is a recap post about my challenges, as a bonus I even put an extra meal that I did (my own recipe, waddup Gordon).</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really know how to organize this post so I&rsquo;ll just write the same format as Alex and then randomly insert pictures of my final results.</p>

<p>All in all, I would give myself a pass, but I only passed the taste test and failed every other criteria that I set myself so&hellip; I&rsquo;m the only one that can be blamed for that&hellip;. My breakfast took an hour instead of 20 minutes, I went out and bought a few ingredients for my lunch challenge and it took more than 2 hours to make my supper&hellip; Again, I can only blame myself for thinking I was that good.</p>

<p><strong>Breakfast Evaluation:</strong></p>

<p>Alex: 7/10<br />
Gab: 8/10<br />
Nic: 7.5/10</p>

<p>Average: 7.5/10 PASS</p>

<p><strong>Lunch Evaluation:</strong></p>

<p>Steven: 8.1/10<br />
Nic: 7/10</p>

<p>Average: 7.8/10 PASS</p>

<p><strong>Supper Evaluation:</strong></p>

<p>Nic: 8.5/10<br />
Annie: 7/10<br />
Mom: 9/10<br />
Alex: 7/10</p>

<p>Average: 7.875/10 PASS</p>

<p><strong>What I did well:</strong></p>

<p>Not the Worst: Not to praise myself, but I think I am a naturally good chef or at least, am very good at following recipes. In all the meals that I did, I never made anything that tasted horribly and some of them even tasted pretty good. So I followed the recipes pretty well.</p>

<p>A Quick Learner: I was pretty quick at picking up methods to cook more quickly and also starting to notice ways of saving my meals. For example, when I cooked my tacos, we had to close the lid to soften the tacos meat. So, when I was cooking my lunch meal and fucked up by putting the vegetables at the end of the stir fry (so everything else was already soft and the vegetables were still hard), I quickly put a lid on it and at the end, my vegetables were able to soften without making a mush out of everything else.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/hsb/quart/nkc1-4-final-cooking4.jpg" alt="Lunch Meal" />
This meal is like a fajita stir fry with bell peppers, beans, broccoli and Monterey Jack Cheese. Served with red quinoa (Vegetarian lunch meal). Sorry about the quality of this one, I forgot to properly take a picture of it&hellip; mybad. The fajitas dressing is <a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/232967/fajita-seasoning/">here</a> the rest I just improvised</p>

<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>

<p>I really thought that finding time to cook would be super easy since I always see my mom cooking (like everyday) so I just said to myself that I would help her cook in order to learn, but I was <del>so busy</del> distracted with other things that I really just cooked maybe 7-8 times in a month. So yeah, just finding time to go buy the ingredients and cook, that was pretty hard.</p>

<p>Another Challenge was actually knowing where my meal was going. I mean, for some meals, it was pretty straight forward and I cook see the end of the tunnel, but on some other meals, like the tacos, I was sometimes just wondering if the meal would taste like a 1/10 or 10/10 just because I didn&rsquo;t know what was happening. I guess I was just blindly following the recipes and not knowing what I was doing was pretty challenging.</p>

<p>Finally, something that I didn&rsquo;t even think about when starting this challenge is all the preparation. From doing the groceries, to even having the right tools to cook, I realized that I really didn&rsquo;t know anything. In terms of groceries, before this challenge, I never understood how hard it was to cook meals without breaking the bank. I mean shit, if you don&rsquo;t buy stuff when they&rsquo;re on sale, groceries for a single meal can cost like 40$ PER MEAL. So yeah man, when you compare all the effort of cooking AND the price of groceries, I can understand how people would sometimes eat McDonald&rsquo;s instead of cooking. Also, in terms of tools, for my butternut squash pasta take 2, my mom actually bought a dough roller and MAN, let me tell you that it was SO. MUCH. EASIER. So yeah, it&rsquo;s good to be ghetto sometimes, but it can make your life a whole lot more complicated.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/hsb/quart/nkc1-4-final-cooking3.jpg" alt="Pasta Meal" />
This is the butternut squash ravioli take number 2. Made with a dough roller and a wood board also. It was so much easier than using a full bottle of wine. Recipe is <a href="https://tasty.co/recipe/easy-butternut-squash-ravioli">here</a></p>

<p><strong>What I learned:</strong></p>

<p>I learned that refried beans taste gooooood <strong>AF</strong>. When I did my Huevos Rancheros for breakfast, I had to put a bit of refried beans on top of the tortilla, but even while eating it alone. It was so delicious, but also deliciously unhealthy haha.</p>

<p>More seriously though, I learned that cooking can be actually FUN, but it can also be really hard if you&rsquo;re not used to doing all the basic stuff such as cutting onions, chopping garlic or just chopping in general (like chopping herbs is really weird and hard unless you do the &ldquo;chop randomly&rdquo; technique, which is always easy to do).</p>

<p>I also learned that I&rsquo;m really not passionated about cooking food. I really love eating food, but I just find that cooking is too frustrating for the amount of goodness that comes out of it. BUT it does what for a really good and not too expensive couples activity. Like if you guys a borderline broke and looking to fill up 3-4 hours of &ldquo;quality&rdquo; time together, you can holla at your boy &ldquo;Cooking Activity&rdquo; because he&rsquo;ll be there for you.</p>

<p>Overall, I just learned a bunch of little stuff here and there about cooking and that if you put enough effort in it, pretty much anyone can cook a decent meal. I know from now on that whenever I want to cook something, I won&rsquo;t be afraid and I just have to take it one step at a time.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/hsb/quart/nkc1-4-final-cooking.jpg" alt="Improvised Meal" />
Improvised meal made with leftovers (kinda like a fried rice thing).</p>

<p><strong>What would I do differently?:</strong></p>

<p>PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE AND MORE PRACTICE. I think that was THE thing that I did really badly. In total I cooked maybe 8 meals and who am I kidding that I&rsquo;ll become Gordon Ramsay worthy in 8 meals. So for the next challenge, I really hope that I&rsquo;ll rap more often than I cooked because if not, it&rsquo;s bound to be a disaster.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/hsb/quart/nkc1-4-final-cooking1.jpg" alt="Huevos Rancheros" />
The Huevos Rancheros I did for breakfast. Recipe can be found here: <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/jamies-huevos-rancheros-recipe-1921736">Jamie&rsquo;s Huevos Rancheros</a></p>

<p><strong>How much time/money did I spend on the challenge:</strong></p>

<p>Overall, I spent maybe 40 hours on this challenge, with an average of 5 hours per meal (including cooking, prepping, grocery shopping). As I mentioned before, I think I could have easily doubled those hours and the end results would have been drastically different.</p>

<p>In terms of money, I don&rsquo;t really know, let&rsquo;s just average it out and say 300$ total because some of my meals were really inexpensive (like the raviolis, I cooked 6 portions for maybe 10$), but others like the tacos were prettyyyyyyy expensive (thankgod this challenge was sponsored by my mom and my girlfriend&rsquo;s mom hahaha).</p>

<p>NOW THAT THIS IS OVER, I CAN FINALLY MOVE ON TO SOMETHING THAT I WAS SUPER DUPER MUPER LOOKING FORWARD TO: THE RAP CHALLENGE.<br />

                    Welcome to HughSamBros! We created this blog to document our successes and failures as we attempt to complete one different challenge every month.
                    From time to time, we also post random stuff on topics that interest us!
