      <description>As you can see, the site is still the same and that is because I have FAILED my first challenge&amp;hellip;. I really wanted to go LIVE with the real website before 2018, but I guess that 6 days isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to learn how to build and DEPLOY a website. However, the good news is that I managed to complete it today and I really like the results. Right now, the only thing left to do is to connect it to Netlify CMS, which is a content management software tool that will allow Alex and I to write our posts online instead of having to write &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo; aka directly in the file.</description>
