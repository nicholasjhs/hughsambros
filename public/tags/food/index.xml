      <description>I LOVE SOUTH AMERICAN FOOD. And I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about the actual taste because I don&amp;rsquo;t think I ever ate any authentic South American food; I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the idea of rice, beans, meat, avocado, salsa, tomatoes, onions and plantains all packed together into a single dirt cheap, but utterly delicious meal ! Now, I know, those probably aren&amp;rsquo;t the most healthy meals, but hey, can&amp;rsquo;t a man just enjoy his good food in peace?</description>

      <description>Ever since I can remember, Wednesdays have always been pasta day in our house. I always found it really peculiar that we had a pasta day in an asian household. I mean, think about it, how many asian families do you know that doesn&amp;rsquo;t eat white rice everyday and even worse, that eats pasta EVERY Wednesday? I, personally, don&amp;rsquo;t know any other asian household, but I guess it has to do less with the fact that we&amp;rsquo;re asian and more with the fact that my mom absolutely LOVES Italian cooking.</description>
