      <description>My second challenge is to be able to cook by the end of January 2018.
Why I&amp;rsquo;m Doing a Cooking Challenge:
I simply don&amp;rsquo;t know how to cook. Okay yes, I can cook instant ramen, make eggs in the morning, put a toast in the toaster and spread some butter or peanut butter on it, but I don&amp;rsquo;t ACTUALLY know how to cook anything else. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit sad to say, but at 22 years old, if my mom would leave us at home for 2 weeks straight, we would probably gain 5lbs each from always eating out or die (one of the two, no in-betweens really).</description>
