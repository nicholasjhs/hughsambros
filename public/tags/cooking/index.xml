      <description>It was a Wednesday night I think (I actually don&amp;rsquo;t know, it just sounds cool to have a specific day) and I was casually scrolling on Facebook, doing my relaxing-brainless activity of the day when I stumbled across a video of a couple doing cooking show called &amp;lsquo;Night In/ Night out&amp;rsquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty cool concept, where this average couple compares the worth of having a night in vs a night out.</description>

      <description>I LOVE SOUTH AMERICAN FOOD. And I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about the actual taste because I don&amp;rsquo;t think I ever ate any authentic South American food; I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the idea of rice, beans, meat, avocado, salsa, tomatoes, onions and plantains all packed together into a single dirt cheap, but utterly delicious meal ! Now, I know, those probably aren&amp;rsquo;t the most healthy meals, but hey, can&amp;rsquo;t a man just enjoy his good food in peace?</description>

      <description>Ever since I can remember, Wednesdays have always been pasta day in our house. I always found it really peculiar that we had a pasta day in an asian household. I mean, think about it, how many asian families do you know that doesn&amp;rsquo;t eat white rice everyday and even worse, that eats pasta EVERY Wednesday? I, personally, don&amp;rsquo;t know any other asian household, but I guess it has to do less with the fact that we&amp;rsquo;re asian and more with the fact that my mom absolutely LOVES Italian cooking.</description>

      <description>My second challenge is to be able to cook by the end of January 2018.
Why I&amp;rsquo;m Doing a Cooking Challenge:
I simply don&amp;rsquo;t know how to cook. Okay yes, I can cook instant ramen, make eggs in the morning, put a toast in the toaster and spread some butter or peanut butter on it, but I don&amp;rsquo;t ACTUALLY know how to cook anything else. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit sad to say, but at 22 years old, if my mom would leave us at home for 2 weeks straight, we would probably gain 5lbs each from always eating out or die (one of the two, no in-betweens really).</description>
