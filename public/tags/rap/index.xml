      <description>My second challenge of 2018 is the rap freestyle challenge!
Background: Imagine the scene where you&amp;rsquo;re at a metro station or a public space and someone starts playing an instrumental song. The beat is real nice, but you won&amp;rsquo;t listen to it more than 3 minutes because it gets repetitive. Suddenly, a dude comes out of nowhere, grabs a mic and starts rapping off his head aka freestyling. Then, people start filming, people post on youtube, shit gets 20M views, the dude goes on Ellen and the rest is history.</description>

      <description>My second challenge of 2018 is the rap freestyle challenge!
Background:
If you&amp;rsquo;ve known me for a while, then you probably know that I love hip-hop and rap (extra props if you know who my favourite rapper is). To be completely honest, I&amp;rsquo;ve always put more importance to the beat and the vibe of the song, more so than the actual lyrics (yup just lost all my street cred), but I still love going on RapGenius to look up the meaning of the lyrics of each song I listen to.</description>
