      <description>HELLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO EVERYBODY !
First of all, I just want to thank everyone who has been (or still is) following our journey. I really wanted to post more videos, but didn&amp;rsquo;t have the discipline to do it so for the next challenge, I&amp;rsquo;m holding myself accountable to most videos. Probably not going to write more blog posts, but definitely more Stories on Instagram and videos on Youtube. Surprise announcement at the end of this post !</description>

      <description>Hey yaaaaalll !!!
I know it&amp;rsquo;s been a really long time that we haven&amp;rsquo;t posted, but we were pretty busy with our lives. However, especially for our rap challenge, I think it&amp;rsquo;ll be a good idea if you follow us on Youtube or on our Instagram if you want more rap updates.
I&amp;rsquo;m just going to make a short post here, but freestyling is actually really fun to do and there were lots of trial and error at the beginning.</description>

      <description>My second challenge of 2018 is the rap freestyle challenge!
Background: Imagine the scene where you&amp;rsquo;re at a metro station or a public space and someone starts playing an instrumental song. The beat is real nice, but you won&amp;rsquo;t listen to it more than 3 minutes because it gets repetitive. Suddenly, a dude comes out of nowhere, grabs a mic and starts rapping off his head aka freestyling. Then, people start filming, people post on youtube, shit gets 20M views, the dude goes on Ellen and the rest is history.</description>

      <description>My second challenge of 2018 is the rap freestyle challenge!
Background:
If you&amp;rsquo;ve known me for a while, then you probably know that I love hip-hop and rap (extra props if you know who my favourite rapper is). To be completely honest, I&amp;rsquo;ve always put more importance to the beat and the vibe of the song, more so than the actual lyrics (yup just lost all my street cred), but I still love going on RapGenius to look up the meaning of the lyrics of each song I listen to.</description>
