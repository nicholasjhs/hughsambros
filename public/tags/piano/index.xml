      <description>My third challenge of the 2018 Kaizen Challenge is to learn the piano !
R.I.P. To My App:
This is just a short paragraph to say rest in peace to the application that I never made. Honestly, my plan was to make the app in February so that I can add a project to my C.V. when applying for my full-time job. The thing is, I&amp;rsquo;m not even interested in working as a software developper and even LESS interested in working in mobile dev so I said screw the app.</description>
