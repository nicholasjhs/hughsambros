                                For as long as I can remember, I was always interested by so many things and, especially when I was young,
                                I would always daydream about being a Basketball Star, a Rapper, a Live Performer, a Professional Badminton Player, a Dancer and all these other cool ass careers.
                                But, my younger self had other daily plans including playing MapleStory and binge-watching animes (which I still do)
                                so I was only able to dedicate myself to one activity, Badminton.<br><br>

                                Today, I'm a 22 years old Software Engineering student (not a professional Badminton Player) and although I quite like my field of study, I'm always asking myself
                                "What if I learned this skill" or "What if I practiced that activity" where would I be now. And, honestly, I don't even know if I actually like those things or
                                if it just seems better than what I currently have. So, when my brother told me about this 30 day challenge, I took this as an opportunity to start a
                                self-exploration/self-improvement journey in order to find my interests and, ultimately, kill all those "what ifs".<br><br>

                                So yeah, that's why I started this new chapter and a bit about myself. I hope you enjoy our adventures and that some of you will hop along for the ride!<br><br>

                                Ever since I was a kid, there was only this one question that I didn't really have an answer to (and still don't to this day): "What do you want to do when you grew up?"
                                Other kids would answer they wanted to become a police officer, a teacher, a lawyer, a doctor. On the other hand, I really just wanted to become a Power Rangers (and secretly, I still do).<br><br>

                                Today, three years after graduating as an Electrical Engineer, I am currently working as an IT Consultant at Deloitte, one of the big 4 accounting firms in the world, which is something
                                I never imagined of doing. Do I like my job? Of course I do! It allows me to interact with a bunch of amazing people, to learn and try new things and to solve complex problems,
                                which are all things I love doing. However, is this the job I want to do for the rest of my life? If I am being honest with myself, no it's not.<br><br>

                                And the reason why is because consulting is not my passion. So the real question is, what is my passion? Well, I have no idea. But by creating this blog, I was hopeful that in doing the
                                monthly progression challenges, it would help me in finding what my passion is. And if by the end of the year, I still don't know what my passion is? Well, I would still be doing
                                13 awesome challenges along the way, so it's a win-win in my book.<br><br>

                                I hope you will enjoy HughSamBros and to follow our progress throughout the years to come!<br><br>
