    Ever since I was a kid, there was only this one question that I didn't really have an answer to (and still don't to this day): "What do you want to do when you grew up?" Other kids would answer they wanted to become a police officer, a teacher, a lawyer, a doctor. On the other hand, I really just wanted to become a Power Rangers (and secretly, I still do).

    Today, three years after graduating as an Electrical Engineer, I am currently working as an IT Consultant at Deloitte, one of the big 4 accounting firms in the world, which is something I never imagined of doing. Do I like my job? Of course I do! It allows me to interact with a bunch of amazing people, to learn and try new things and to solve complex problems, which are all things I love doing. However, is this the job I want to do for the rest of my life? If I am being honest with myself, no it's not.

    And the reason why is because consulting is not my passion. So the real question is, what is my passion? Well, I have no idea. But by creating this blog, I was hopeful that in doing the monthly progression challenges, it would help me in finding what my passion is. And if by the end of the year, I still don't know what my passion is? Well, I would still be doing 13 awesome challenges along the way, so it's a win-win in my book.

    I hope you will enjoy HughSamBros and to follow our progress throughout the years to come!

    -Alex.

    For as long as I can remember, I was always interested by so many things and, especially when I was young, I would always daydream about being a Basketball Star, a Rapper, a Live Performer, a Professional Badminton Player, a Dancer and all these other cool ass careers. But, my younger self had other daily plans including playing MapleStory and binge-watching animes (which I still do) so I was only able to dedicate myself to one activity, Badminton.

    Today, I'm a 22 years old Software Engineering student (not a professional Badminton Player) and although I quite like my field of study, I'm always asking myself "What if I learned this skill" or "What if I practiced that activity" where would I be now. And, honestly, I don't even know if I actually like those things or if it just seems better than what I currently have. So, when my brother told me about this 30 day challenge, I took this as an opportunity to start a self-exploration/self-improvement journey in order to find my interests and, ultimately, kill all those "what ifs".

    So yeah, that's why I started this new chapter and a bit about myself. I hope you enjoy our adventures and that some of you will hop along for the ride!

It's always been a dream of ours to start a company together, and **HughSamBros** is the first step towards that goal. One commonality that we both (*sadly*) share, is that we always want to try and do so many things, but we never end up doing it. Publishing content online allows us to share our passion of trying new things and keeps us accountable along the way. The purpose of this blog is mainly to document both of our journeys of self-improvement and to hopefully inspire a few along the way.

-Alex & Nich.
