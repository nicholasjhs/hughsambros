Yup. I failed. The first challenge of this project and I am starting with a failure. Certainly, not the way I wanted my 2017 to end, but it is what it is. Instead of sulking and making excuses for why I didn't complete this challenge, I thought it would be a lot more instructional for me to list what were my mistakes and what I could've done instead to turn this failure into a learning experience.

So I've had this issue for a while. Whenever I have to do something, and I know I either can't complete the task quickly or I am (or think I am) not particularly good at it (in this case it's both!), then I will usually postpone the task until the very last minute. I tend to freeze whenever I see a big task ahead of me and tend to just push it or forget about it as much as I can until I HAVE to do it. This is exactly what happened with this challenge. Knowing that I wouldn't be 100% motivated to do the vision board, I shouldn't have approached this problem the way I did, which is to make a HUGE list of everything I wanted to list on the board, AND THEN go ahead and find all the pictures I wanted AND THEN print all of the pictures AND THEN start pinning them on the board. Instead of having four big phases to this project, I should've broken down each phase into smaller pieces. So instead of having one sit down where I would find all the pictures I wanted, I could've found pictures that represent my goals for my Career, print them and pin them on the board. Then the next day, I would do the same process but for my Relationships, etc. This way, I would always see a continuous progress (or should I say a KAIZEN) of my Vision Board and won't be demotivated.

The other important factor that leads to the failure of my challenge, is the fact that I never set any actual time for me to sit down and do my vision board. This was during the Christmas break, so I always had something to do or someone to see or somewhere to go. Knowing that I already wasn't motivated to do the Vision Board, it was very naive of myself to think that I would want to sit down and do my Vision Board during my downtime between two events during the day or late at night when I would come back home. What I should've done is to actually reserve time on my calendar for me to sit down and do some work. It's crazy because I use calendars to set up meeting and events with your friends, or for work or with your family, but I don't have the habit to book myself some time.

So to summarize the learnings of my failure:

* Break-down your project into very small pieces, so you're not intimidated or discouraged by how much you have left. Always start with something small to gain momentum.

* Reserve time on your calendar for your yourself. Your time is important as well, especially when you have side-projects!

My goal is to still complete my vision board (and I will dedicate some time in my calendar to do it!), but my priority for this month will be my next challenge: The Hockey Challenge!! And I'm super excited to start this one.
