As you can see, the site is still the same and that is because I have FAILED my first challenge.... I really wanted to go LIVE with the real website before 2018, but I guess that 6 days isn't enough to learn how to build and DEPLOY a website. However, the good news is that I managed to complete it today and I really like the results. Right now, the only thing left to do is to connect it to Netlify CMS, which is a content management software tool that will allow Alex and I to write our posts online instead of having to write "code" aka directly in the file. Hopefully, by the end of the day, you'll be able to see the new website when you go to www.hughsambros.com. Now, I have a few things that I have to mention, I already failed my challenge, but I unfortunately also had to cut a few corners given my short timeline and here they are:


* Comment Section:
    I decided to use a third party app called [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) to integrate a comment section in our posts. I searched on the web and this seemed to be the best solution for a quick commenting system and I also know a lot of sites that use it. I also enabled the "guest commenting" functionality so that viewers don't require a disqus account to comment. In the future, I might consider creating my own static commenting system when I'll be more familiar with Hugo.

* Archive Page:
    On the website, I originally wanted to put an archive section by month and year to make it easier to search for all our posts; however, I wasn't really sure how to implement the links for the archive page and whatever so I decided not to do it for now. Plus, since our website only has like 6 posts right now, I don't think you'll have a hard time finding all the posts. With that being said, by the end of the year, if all goes well and hughsambros is still alive, I will implement and archive system.

* Pictures:
    Yeah.... humm... most pictures that you see on the website are just free stock pictures that we got from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) (which is a SUPER cool website, where you can find SUPER cool free pictures, yay for free !) because we needed to have some images on our site, but in the near future, we'll most likely change them (especially the pictures in the about us section that are just gray backgrounds with the picture dimensions....)
    Kaizen Challenge Section:
    Okay so first of all, we changed our "Monthly Progression Challenge" to "The Kaizen Challenge" because we're cool, hippy and asian, but THAT section in the new website is supposed to show the 2 most recent posts related to the Kaizen Challenge; however, I can't get the thing to work so I just posted 2 cool, hippy and asian pictures instead !

* Update: Speed Test:
    HAHHAHAHAHAH I don't know if I should be laughing or crying, but the new website got a 0/100 and 0/100 on the google page speed test meaning that it is SUUUUUPER slow. Yelp, looks like you guys won't have the new website anytime soon !

* Update: Speed Test2:
    I managed to get to to 55/100 and 65/100 for mobile and desktop respectively. It still needs a lot of work, but it is not atrocious right now.

I also would like to give a few shoutouts because even though my site isn't complete, I think that without these people, it would have been even shittier.

* Felix @ [Akia Marketing](akiamarketing.ca): Merci de m'avoir aider à commencer le site et tout le setup, j'ai vraiment apprécié avoir ton Git repo pour me référer lorsque je ne comprenais rien (même si je ne comprends toujours pas tout tout tout haha). Merci aussi d'avoir répondu à toutes mes questions, je sais que ça pouvait devenir énervant.

* Gab: Thanks for the logo ! Even though it's only a temporary one, Alex and I still appreciate the time you took to get things done.

* Of Course, Alex: Even though you were having a blast at your chalet, you still took the to finish writing off the few bits of information that I needed even at the expense of you also failing your first challenge (Yay, Welcome to the Club !!). Also, design and blablabla !


That's the end of it. As I mentioned in my first post, when I'm done with the website and the content management software, I'll try to upload a tutorial, but I can't guarantee how good it'll be. Until next time.

-Nich.
