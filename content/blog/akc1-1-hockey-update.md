This challenge has been a lot harder than what I thought, and not for the reasons that I thought either! Let me explain. For one, it's fairly hard to find a right time to go out and practice on ice, because it has to be perfect conditions.

It can't be rainy, it can't be snowy (if not you can easily lose your pucks, you have to shovel a lot and you have less space to actually play) and it can't be freezing outside (by freezing, I mean lower than -30 oC). The only time where you can really go outside and practice is if it's between 0 and -20 AND it can't be snowing either (for the reasons I explained above), which is surprisingly very rare to have.

The other hard part is that I actually need to make time to PRACTICE and NOT to play. I initially told myself that this would be an easy challenge since I already play hockey twice a week, so I would be able to fit in my challenge during those days and maybe add an extra session if I had time. HOWEVER, I barely have time to do my shots when I am playing. You just don't have that tranquillity or time or space to just practice your shots.

Which is why starting this week, I told myself that I have to be more disciplined and reserve time to actually go outside by myself and practice. Luckily, today was one of those "ideal situation" days, so I was super excited to be able to practice. I only had the opportunity to practice once last week, so I felt it at the very beginning that I was rusty. My shot was horrible and I just couldn't seem to aim properly. As time passed by, I slowly got better and better and at the end, I would say my aiming was back as well.

I felt that I was taking too much time shooting the puck, so at the end of my session, I tried shooting faster to see how it went. It honestly wasn't that bad, but I still have a LONG way to go, which is a bit scary, since we are already halfway through the month. The next few days are looking like really good days as well, so I am hopeful that I will be able to get a lot of practice in.
