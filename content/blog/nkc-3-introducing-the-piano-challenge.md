My third challenge of the 2018 Kaizen Challenge is to learn the piano !

**R.I.P. To My App:**

This is just a short paragraph to say rest in peace to the application that I never made. Honestly, my plan was to make the app in February so that I can add a project to my C.V. when applying for my full-time job. The thing is, I'm not even interested in working as a software developper and even LESS interested in working in mobile dev so I said screw the app. Voil√†.

**Background:**

Growing up as an asian, you would think that my parents made me learn the piano as a kid, but my parents weren't about that "force your child to do a bunch of sh*t" life so I basically spent my whole childhood doing whatever I wanted aka nothing. And by nothing I mean, playing video games (yay for MapleStory, Soldier Front and Gunz) and watching LOTS of anime/TV shows.

Now that I'm all grown up, I really have this urge to learn an instrument and especially now, coming off the rap challenge, my music interested has grown even more. That's why I wanted to learn an instrument as a challenge.
