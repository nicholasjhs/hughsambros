Sooo...... I almost wanted to give up on the whole Kaizen Challenge, but especially this challenge. Let me explain.

Two days ago, I was learning the beginning of a song called "Mood" by dvsn (went to their concert, it was AWESOME btw) and I realized that my challenge was called "learn to play piano", but I wasn't actually learning; I was just memorizing. Needless to say, any piano expert in the world would tell you that actually learning to play the piano (I never really defined what "play the piano" meant for my challenge) is impossible to do in 1 month. I, then, realized that most of my "art" challenges also have very obscur goals.

For exemple, next month I'm doing my "choreography" challenge, but what's the "challenge"? Create 4 videos. Okay sure, but any Joe Bloe on the street can make 4 dancing videos, I never said anything about the quality of the videos. Same thing for the challenge this month. "Learning to play piano" is something very subjective to a person's definition of "playing the piano". Maybe for some people, learning 1 song by heart and playing it is considered as "playing the piano". But, if you asked Lang Lang or Yiruma... I could bet a pretty hefty sum that they wouldn't consider that as "learning to play the piano".

Thus, I realized that, unlike most of Max Deutsch's challenges, I didn't really have any defined goals and it made it really hard to see the end of the tunnel. This shit is hard honestly (especially without a mentor or teacher) and without a clear goal, I think you can easily get lost in what you're doing.

However comma, after talking to Alex about my mid-Kaizen Challenge crisis, I decided to stick with my original challenges, BUT I will define myself a clear goal EVERY time. It doesn't matter if the goal sucks, or if it's not like the hardest shit ever, the goal of these challenges was to explore my interests and explore is what I'll do.

I hope that this can slightly motivate people by telling you guys that I had my doubts about these challenges and that, at times, I wish that I could just give them up and do whatever I feel like doing at this moment like (**Spoiler Alert**) doing tech reviews and discussing interesting topics with the Brosky aka Alexander the Great, but I told myself that I was going to do these challenges so I'll stick with them until the end !!

**THE GOAL THIS MONTH IS SIMPLY TO LEARN 1 FUCKING WHOLE SONG ON THE PIANO AND PLAY IT FOR A CROWD.** PEACE
