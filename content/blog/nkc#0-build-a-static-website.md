My first challenge is to build a static website that will replace the current website in 2018.

**Background:**

I've always had an interest in building a static website, but I never found any good motivation to do it so when HughSamBros came up, I jumped at the gun and told Alex that I'll take care of the website. The initial plan was to start right off the bat with the static website and document everything on it; however, I wanted the site to be my first challenge. Consequently, we decided to use a temporary blog (SquareSpace) to log our first challenge and use the static site for the rest of our challenges starting January 2018.

**Why We're Using a Static Website:**

The first reason is that hosting is entirely free. I'll probably be deploying the website with Netlify and having a personal account with unlimited site deployments costs 0$ (might write a post on this, but for the time being you can read more [here](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/)). So even though SquareSpace isn't THAT expensive (14$/month), we can all agree that 0$ is better than any amount.

The second reason is that building the site ourselves simply offers more flexibility. Even though SquareSpace is a really nice platform, anyone who has ever used it knows that it has its limitations and in order to build our blog how WE envisioned it, then we needed something with more liberty (especially since we have the knowledge to do it) aka this challenge.

**What is the Challenge:**

The challenge is that by January 1st 2018, I will have successfully built a static website that will become our official HughSamBros blog page. Of course, modifications will be allowed during the year, but the main idea is to build a usable website that encompasses our vision.

**How Will I Achieve this Challenge:**

I broke down this challenge in 3 steps.

1. Looks: For this part, since I'm not a UX Designer or an Artist, I simply asked Alex to find an online HTML template that closely resembles his vision of our blog.

2. Organization & Content: This step is basically putting the whole project together to make it deployable with Netlify. To do this, I will inspire myself of other websites and see how they structure their content and files.

3. Our Own Flavour: This last step will be about adding the little tweaks to the website. This can be anything from adding more functions to changing the text color. The "hardness" of this part will be very dependent on how picky we are and, especially, what template we found in step #1.

So yeah, this is my first challenge. I know it might seem confusing, but I'll try to write as many posts as possible and explain as many things along the building process. I'll also try to record myself building the website for anyone interested in building one themselves. Lastly, feel free to contact us [here](www.hughsambros.com/singles/contact/ "Contact Us")Â for any questions regarding this challenge or static websites.
