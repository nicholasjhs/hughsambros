HEY GUYS !!! I'm finally **DONE** with school and am totally ready to start building the new website (yayyy, I only have like 4 days left to build it), but before I do, I just want to write a brief post about what exactly is a static website.

If you take all the websites that exist, you can separate them into 2 broad categories. The first one is Dynamic Websites and the second one is Static Websites. The best way to illustrate the difference is through an example:

**Dynamic Website**

A common dynamic website that everyone interacts with is Facebook. When you log into Facebook or I log into Facebook, we both have different accounts so we see different stories or highlights on our news feed. I mean yeah, the overall look of the website is the same (the chat on the righthand side, the search bar on top, shortcuts and pages on the left), BUT the actually posts that we see are very different and that is because the content (posts) are loaded dynamically. Dynamically basically means that before showing us anything, it has to do a few computations before loading the content. For Facebook, these computations are like looking which people we're friends with, getting the latest updates from those friends, putting them in chronological order (not sure if that's a thing in facebook) and finally putting them in our news feed.

**Static Website**

The easiest example that I can find are most restaurant websites. So if you and I would go to a website say [Restaurant Mon Ami](http://www.restomonami.com/chicken/), we would see the exact same information. It doesn't matter if you're Kendrick Lamar or Nicholas Hugh Sam, we would see the exact same thing. This is because all the information is already written out so when you access the website, it simply displays what is written.

**Main Differences**

Dynamic Websites use a database to store information whereas static websites don't (less $$)
Static Websites load faster because you don't need to do computations before loading the site
Dynamic Websites are usually better for web applications that need to store data
Final Thoughts

So, I hope I haven't lost you yet, but the main takeaway is that static websites are good for displaying fixed information and dynamic websites are good for displaying "personalized" (or catered) information. I would also like to mention that a dynamic website can also be used to display "fixed information", but in my opinion, you would be better off using a static website. Lastly, I would like to say that I'm no expert on static websites (or even dynamic websites for that matter) as I JUST learnt about them 4 months ago so if I send anything wrongful, then please comment or contact us and I will gladly rectify the post. As always, you guys can always contact us or comment for any additional information on this topic and we will gladly answer you. Until next time. Peace

-Nich
