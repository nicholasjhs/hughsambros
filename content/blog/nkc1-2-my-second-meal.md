I **LOVE** SOUTH AMERICAN FOOD. And I'm not talking about the actual taste because I don't think I ever ate any _authentic_ South American food; I'm talking about the idea of rice, beans, meat, avocado, salsa, tomatoes, onions and plantains all packed together into a single dirt cheap, but utterly delicious meal ! Now, I know, those probably aren't the most healthy meals, but hey, can't a man just enjoy his good food in peace?

In honor of my love of South American food, the second meal I made were homemade tacos served with some tortilla chips and some guacamole.

I must admit that I don't take the easiest meals to make (lasagna was an easy one, but homemade tacos? Really? ~~And freshly made pasta really?~~), but yeah, I decided to not care about how hard the recipe was going to be, as long as it was food that I loved eating. I think the whole experiment went fairly well overall and that it was a more successful meal than my previous lasagna (yay for progress !).
