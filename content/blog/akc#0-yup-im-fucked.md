Alright, so it's December 29th and I still haven't started my vision board. What's worst, is that I have something planned every day until the New Year, so I have even less (no) time to complete my challenge! BUT NO EXCUSES! I am going to start the New Years on a good note and complete this vision board. At the very least, I already bought a cork board and some pins as well, so that's a start.

Since I am in a time sensitive situation and don't have the luxury to mindlessly browse the internet/magazines for inspiration, I will need to develop a plan on what I want to put on my vision board. Being an inherently logical person, I will start by approaching the problem (developing a plan for my vision board) in a logical way, and go from there.

-Insert Picture-

You don't clearly see it in the picture above, but the cork board is 18"x24", which means I can easily divide the board either into 6 or 9 squares. Logical me is happy since this means that I just need to find 6 or 9 topics/areas that are important to me and use that as a starting point for my vision board.

Here are some areas/topics that I initially thought about:


+ Short-Term goals (ex: 2018-2019)

+ Long-Term goals (ex: before I die)

+ Life values

+ Career

+ What I want to do

+ Relationships

+ Finances

+ Home

+ Personal Growth

+ Health

+ Travel

I would be able to insert short+term and long+term goals for every area, which means I would have 8 topics left. Not exactly ideal, since I wanted either 6 or 9, but we'll start with this and if I don't like it, then I'll either merge topics together or add a new one. Now what I would want to do is to separate each topic into short+term and long+term goals.

The updated version of the list above now looks like this:


+ Life values

    + Authenticity

    + Kaizen

    + Humble

+ Career


    + Short-Term


        + Have a thousand views on hughsambros blog

        + Have sponsors for HughSamBros challenges

        + Learn more about marketing and sales

        + Become a better consultant

    + Long-Term


        + Open a coffee/tea shop

        + Create a company with NHS

        + Good work environment, with lots of light and surrounded by motivated people

+ Relationships


    + Meet new, interesting and motivated people

    + Maintain good relationships with family, close friends, friends, colleagues

    + (Re)find love??

+ Finances


    + Short-Term


        + Buy an apartment with MGM

        + Spend less money on useless things

        + Save more money

        + Look into Cryptocurrency

    + Long-Term


        + Investments are good

        + Have multiple revenue streams

+ Personal Growth


    + Short-Term


        + Meditate 20 min a day

        + Complete all 12.5 Hughsambros challenges

        + Find my passion

        + Be a better writer

        + Be more creative

        + Travel to South America

        + Read more books

        + Take more notes

        + Discover new artists

    + Long-Term


        + Travel more

        + Have Fun

+ Health


    + Short-Term


        + Play a lot of hockey

        + Go back to the gym

        + Rehabilitate injured leg

    + Long-Term


        + No major injuries

+ People I Look up to


    + Chance the Rapper

    + PK Subban

    + Elon Musk

I ended up removing the home category, and replaced it with People I look up to, instead. I also removed short-term/long+term for a few areas as well, since it didn't make sense to have them there. Now that I listed everything I wanted to put on my vision board, I realize that not all categories are equal, so I won't make sense to separate them equally. I have 2 more days to go, so the next step is to find a bunch of pictures that I like that represent everything that I wrote-down.

-Alex.
