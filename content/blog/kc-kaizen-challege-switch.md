In life, we need to learn how to adapt and since I am a handicap track boy who currently can't do shit with my legs, I had to move most
of my physical challenges at the end of the year. Since we're at it, why not re-do the whole order to make it more optimal (for example, Alex is planning to go to Guatemala in June so why not do the "Learn a New Language Challenge" the month before !) and fun (we're doing the rap challenge this month because it was a challenge we couldn't wait to do ! ~~YO YO YO MC HUGHSAMBROS~~).
