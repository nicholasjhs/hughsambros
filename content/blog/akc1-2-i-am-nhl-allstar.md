Hey everyone! Yup, I've been pretty bad with updating the blog, BUT unlike the vision board, I was able to complete the challenge (GO ME)!!

Since I haven't uploaded a lot, here's me ALMOST completing the challenge the day before:

And here's a video of me completing the challenge the morning after with a few kids in the background watching me do it (can only hear them not see them):

**What I did well:**

I started going a MUST DO LIST at the end of every day, and make a very small list of tasks that I had to do the following day. I think this was a big game changer for me since I tried to respect it as much as possible and motivated me, even more, to go out and complete my challenge. Every time I would check the weather and it was somewhat cold outside, I'd most likely list on my to-do list that I had to practice for my hockey challenge and 90% of the time I was able to follow through. I believe doing this and trying to remain disciplined throughout the month (more during the second half) were the two keys to the success of this challenge.

**Challenges:**

 I initially thought that this would be a super easy challenge since I LOVE playing hockey. But that's the mistake I made. There is a BIG difference between going outside and playing ice hockey with your friends vs just going to a rink by yourself and practicing for the challenge.

Another challenge I faced, and I'm pretty sure I will be facing in every challenge this year is being consistent. I can't stress how important being consistent is in actually doing what you need to do.

**What I learned:**

The most important lesson I learned this month, was the importance of saying NO and trying to remain disciplined. The first few weeks, I tried to convince myself that I would be able to arrive a bit early at a hockey game and just practice a bit of shooting before playing. I learned the hard way that if I continued like this, I would be facing another failure at the end of the month, and had to change my approach to make sure I was able to get the W.

Another that I learned is that it's really cool looking back where you were just a month ago and how much you grew in just a few sessions. I remember it used to take me around 7-14 shots just to get one top corner, and at the end, I was able to average out in around 1-4 pucks. I also wasn't able to lift the puck when doing a slap-shop, and now I can do it from time to time. I'm not really sure how practicing wrist shots were able to translate to me doing slap-shots, but I'm going to take it!

Going into technicalities, I found it pretty cool that I really had to break-down the whole mechanic of doing a wrist-shot and trying to improve every little detail to make sure I was able to complete the challenge. So a wrist shot is not just shooting the puck. It's getting a good stance with your legs, having a good core, grabbing the puck correctly, having a quick release, and aiming with your eyes and stick when releasing!

One final thing I learned, and I'm pretty embarrassed to admit this, but I also never knew how to upload a youtube video, and well now I can!

**What would I do differently?:**

Since I was able to complete the challenge, I'm not sure if I would change anything haha. But I definitely would try and go out more often to practice. I also think that I would've liked to improve the timing of my release since even at the end, you can see me juggling with the puck a few seconds before releasing it.

How much time/money did I spend on the challenge
I believe I went out 6 times in total throughout the month and I usually went for an hour and a half, so that would be 10.5h in total that I spent just practicing my shot. I'm pretty sure the fact that I was playing hockey throughout the month helped as well, but I didn't count it as actual practice.

For this challenge, I spent around 80$ to buy the goalie pad that I was used to practicing my shots with and around 25$ for more pucks.

All in all, I'm really glad about my performance for the challenge, and I am pretty excited to start my next one!
