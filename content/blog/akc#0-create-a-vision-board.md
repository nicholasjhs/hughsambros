My first challenge is to create my own vision board.

**Background:**

Around a year ago, I decided to get a life coach, because I was really interested in self development, and since I had some extra cash lying around, I decided to use that to good use and invest it on myself. After a few sessions with her, one of my tasks was to create a vision board. To be completely honest, I did a really botched job of creating one, and didn't even look at it or use it after the fact. Basically, it was useless.

A few months later, I remembered about my vision board and since I wasn't using it, I decided to re-start it and do a physical one where I would be able to put in front of my bed, so that I never miss it. I decided to go to the closest Bureau en Gros (which is the Quebec equivalent of Staples) and bought myself a cork board, so that I can pin pictures on it. Well... that was my original plan, but lazy Alex decided otherwise and decided to leave the cork board blank... Which is the reason why I put it as one of my challenges, so that I have no choice but to complete it (or if I don't, I look pretty dumb).

**Why do I want to create a vision board?**

Other than the fact that this was one of my activities I 'had' to do with my coach, I feel that it's a good idea to have a physical representation of the vision of what you want in life and where you want to go.

You don't need to go into detail, but just to have a general idea of how you want to visualize your life, what you want to have in it and how you want to live can give you a good sense of direction and can make some of your life decisions easier and clearer. Use it as a sort of guide that you can always check back to make sure that whatever you are doing is aligned of where you want to go. And obviously, this should be something that's flexible, since your life and your vision of your future life can change at any moment.

As a big sports fan, I tell myself if most athletes use visualization to mentally prepare for a big game, then why wouldn't you want to do the same, but for your entire life?

**What is the challenge:**

The challenge is to create a vision board, using the cork board that I bought and make it as nice as possible. Now, I know this is vague, but you have to know that I am probably the worst person to do an arts & craft related project. Thus, if my vision board looks like it is done by a kid that is older than 10 years old, I'll declare the challenge completed. Trust me on this one, if you know me well, you know that this criteria is a lot harder than it seems.

**How will I complete this challenge:**

I guess I don't have one specific plan on how to complete my vision board. What I want to do is to think of important areas in my life, and print out either quotes or pictures that represent either how I want to feel or want I want to have or what I want to see in my near or long-term future.

These areas would be in business, personal, friends, family, love life and finances.

Ready to finally get started!
