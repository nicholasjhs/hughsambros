Today is the last day of the rap challenge, which means, my final chance to do a 2-min freestyle! 

Here is my final freestyle for the month:

Nic and I decided to a brotherly competition and will be posting a poll on our [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hughsambros/) so that you can vote which one had the best final rap, so please follow us so that you don't miss out (hint: the poll will most likely be on tomorrow!).

## What I did well

Out of all the challenges I've done so far (2.5 in total), this challenge was the one I was the most consistent in. 

Two factors helped a lot in this matter:

* **Practice**: I was able to practice pretty much anywhere. The only thing I needed was something to play music and a good instrumental playlist (thanks Spotify). Actually, you don't even NEED music. Sometimes I would just see words and would immediately try and find words that would rhyme, which contributed in improving my overall rapping skills.
* **Time**: It doesn't take a lot of time to practice. I think this is more of a consequence of the above, but the fact that I was able to just turn on some music and start rapping right away helped me a lot of this challenge

## Challenges / What I learned

One thing I learned during this challenge is that **RAPPING IS HARD**. Going into this challenge at the beginning of the month, I honestly thought I would be able to complete the challenge fairly easily, but boy was I wrong. The moment I knew this challenge would be hard? The exact moment I started filming myself for my first rap video and I can barely do a two straight lines that rhymed.

If we break down the elements of what exactly is hard in rapping, it'd be the following:

* **Flowing**: Flow is so so so important. My friend Cheetah stated well: "_You don't even need to rhyme, if you're able to flow on the beat, you'll be fine_". If you listen to rappers, you can notice that they do not always rhyme. As long as they follow the flow, then it barely gets noticed if you skip a few lines without rhyming (just make sure not to do it too much). 
* **Getting our of your head**: Another element that I found to be really important was to get out of your head. Especially at the beginning when you just don't know what to say, you have to take the time to just spit whatever comes from your head, and when I say anything, I mean **ANYTHING. **It could be as simple as "_Yeah so I'm spitting now and don't know what to say, maybe I can go to church a bit so that I can go pray_". It doesn't make sense, but it's whatever came out of my head at that exact moment.
* **Transition: **This was probably the hardest for me. Because I didn't concentrate as much as flowing at the beginning, in my head, I HAD to rhyme every 2 lines, so I had a hard time understanding how to effectively transition from one line to another to start a new rhyme. It just felt weird to go from let's say "Yo, I'm just spitting some rhyme/Just gonna chill on my time" to "I don't care what other people think", and continue from there, but that's what rap is haha.
* **Rhyming: **Yes, rhyming was pretty hard, but I honestly thought that was the easiest part. No, I didn't have the sickest rhymes or the best ones either, and still had some difficulty to rhyme words together, but if I needed to rank myself on each element, I'd probably rank rhyming the highest (which probably wouldn't be THAT high anyways).

## What would I do differently

There are two main things that I would do differently for this challenge:

* **Deliberate Practice**: Deliberate Practice is SO important when you are trying to improve at something and without deliberate practice, it takes a lot more time and effort to get to the next level. Now, what is deliberate practice? To achieve deliberate practice, your practice needs to be _focused_, it needs to put you in an _uncomfortable situations _so that you can make mistakes, and most importantly, you need to received _feedback_ so that you can improve on those mistakes. I never really had feedback during my challenge, which made it harder for me to focus on what I needed to improve. 
* **Adapt to how you learn**: I'm not going to lie, I basically took the framework Max Deutsch (the guy who inspired me to do HughSamBros) used to complete his rap challenge and applied it to me and followed it pretty much to the letter. I realized (a bit too late) that I probably wasn't on part with him at the very beginning and had to improve on just flowing and getting out of my head FIRST, instead of going right away into rhyming.

## How much time/money I spent on this challenge

I'll keep it short and sweet for this one. When I practised, I usually spent around 15 to 30 min a day and I skipped maybe 5 days in total. So I spent around 12.5h in total practising my rapping skills. Was that enough? I think so. There were actually times where I had to take breaks, because I started to always falter back to the same rhymes (and still do!) I could even reduce my sessions to 15 minutes, as long as I get into deliberate practice. I already had a mic to register, and used Photo Booth as my program to register myself, so I spent a big total of ZERO dollars for this challenge!

## Conclusion

In all honesty, I didn't think I would be able to freestyle for 2 min straight, BUT the video that I uploaded ISN'T half bad. So I will let the public decide. Is it a yay or nay? 

I really had fun with this challenge, and I am overall disappointed with rap skills, even though I am MUCH better than one month ago. SO, I decided to continue this challenge next month ON TOP of my next challenge. 

AHS OUT!

PEACE
