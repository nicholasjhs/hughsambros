My first challenge of 2018 is the hockey challenge!

**Background:**

My love for hockey has been back and forth while growing up. I've only played casual hockey when I was younger, and only recently have I decided to join a league (a ball hockey league, since I JUST decided to learn how to skate). So I am not starting from scratch, but I am very far away from being a 'good' hockey player.

**Why the hockey challenge?**

When I was thinking of the possible challenges I could do, I knew I just had to include a hockey challenge. Since I am currently playing in two different ball hockey leagues, I thought it'd be a good idea if I did a challenge that would allow me to improve my skills that could translate to my gameplay. Also. I. LOVE. HOCKEY. Simple as that. I love watching hockey. I love talking hockey. I love playing hockey (even though I suck at it).

**What is the challenge:**

The challenge will be a modified version of the accuracy shooting challenge from the NHL All-Stars Skills Competition, as seen in the video below:

The big difference is that I will be removing the passers (I'll have a bunch of pucks next to me instead), and I will be giving myself a time limit of 25 seconds to complete the challenge. This might seem pretty low, but by removing the passers,  this should save me some extra seconds.

**How will I complete this challenge:**

For me to complete this challenge, I will need to focus on two things:
My accuracy when shooting the puck, so that I can aim for the 4 corners
My fast release when shooting the puck, so that I can shoot multiple pucks in my allowed 25 seconds.
My plan is to have many sessions throughout the month, where I will focus on either my accuracy or my release. My current plan is to divide my month into three parts:

* The first week and a half will be dedicated to improving my release
* The second week and a half, I will be improving my accuracy (hopefully by then, I will already have a faster release to work with).
* The final week would be me practicing both at the same time and trying to complete the challenge.

Finally, to make this challenge a bit more interesting, I'll try and film my progress throughout the weeks, so you can view my improvements (or my lack of). And for this challenge to count, I will need to do it on camera as well!

So as they say in hockey, let's do that hockey!

-Alex.
